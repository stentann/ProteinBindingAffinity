This is a regression problem. The training data consists of 27,930 samples, and I provide predictions on 9,311 unlabeled test samples (not uploaded to github). The features are 9,491 dimensional and integer-valued. The labels are real scalar numbers.

Each sample is a different chemical, and the features describe important physical properties of those chemicals. The labels are binding affinity to a molecule of interest.

Final evaluation metrics on unseen data
T1 median absolute error 0.183339083862305	
T1 prediction error 0.177870035171509
T1 mean absolute error 0.320298243616772

76th percentile results in my class for mean absolute error

Note: over 50% of the data has the same label, so median error is a flawed metric for this task. However, it was used in the initial task description so I included it anyway.
